# Breast Cancer Machine Learning Methods Comparison with Monte-Carlo Simulations Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on comparing different machine learning methodologies, including supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and active learning techniques. The analysis is conducted using Monte-Carlo simulations on two datasets: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic and Banknote Authentication. The primary goal is to evaluate these methods based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, with a specific emphasis on learning curves in active learning scenarios.

## Datasets
1. **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**
   - Contains IDs, classes (Benign=B, Malignant=M), and 30 attributes.
2. **Banknote Authentication Dataset**
   - Binary classification dataset for authenticating banknotes.

## Methods
1. **Supervised Learning**
   - L1-penalized SVM training using 5-fold cross-validation.
2. **Semi-Supervised Learning**
   - Combination of labeled and unlabeled data in training SVM.
3. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - K-means clustering assuming two clusters.
4. **Spectral Clustering**
   - Clustering using RBF kernel focusing on data point balance.
5. **Active Learning**
   - SVMs trained with incremental data points selection.
